                <p class="card-text">Being the capital of Italy, it has quite a large population - almost 2.9 million people in 1285 sq km! Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills.
                  Rome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe.
