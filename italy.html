          <h2>Why Rome? Why Italy?</h2>
          <h3></h3>
          <p>
            Italy, officially the Italian Republic, or the Republic of Italy, is a country in South West Europe. Located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, it consists of a peninsula delimited by the Alps and surrounded by several islands.
            Italy shares land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia and the enclaved microstates of Vatic
          </p>
          <p>Rome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe. The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever Imperial city and metropolis. It was first called The Eternal City by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy. Rome is also called "Caput Mundi" (Capital of the World).</p>
        <p>The architecture of Rome over the centuries has greatly developed from Ancient Roman architecture to Italian modern and contemporary architecture. Rome was once the world's main epicentres of Classical architecture, developing new forms such as the arch, the dome and the vault. The Romanesque style in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of Renaissance and Baroque architecture. Rome's cityscape is also widely Neoclassical and Fascist in style.
        </p>
        <p>In the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby Campagna, as lamb and vegetables (globe artichokes are common). In parallel, Roman Jews â€“ present in the city since the 1st century BC â€“ developed their own cuisine, the cucina giudaico-romanesca.

          Examples of Roman dishes include saltimbocca alla romana â€“ a veal cutlet, Roman-style, topped with raw ham and sage and simmered with white wine and butter; carciofi alla romana â€“ artichokes Roman-style, outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; carciofi alla giudia â€“ artichokes fried in olive oil, typical of Roman Jewish cooking, outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; spaghetti alla carbonara â€“ spaghetti with bacon, eggs and pecorino; and gnocchi di semolino alla romana â€“ semolina dumpling, Roman-style</p>
